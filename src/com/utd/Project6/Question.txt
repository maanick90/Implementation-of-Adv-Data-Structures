CS 6301.{013,016}: Implementation of advanced DS&A
Project 6 (Type 3: Extending Data structures)

This project is required.  It is eligible for excellence awards.
Only projects submitted by 1st deadline are eligible for exc award.

Ver 1.0: Mon, Oct 13

Code base: Any data structures (built-in or downloaded) for
implementing dictionaries, and hashing algorithms.

Deadlines: 2 AM on Monday: Oct 27 (1st), Nov 3 (2nd), Nov 10 (3rd).


Multi-dimensional search: Consider the web site of a seller like Amazon.  
They carry tens of thousands of products, and each product has many
attributes (Name, Size, Description, Keywords, Manufacturer, Price, etc.).  
The search engine allows users to specify attributes of products that
they are seeking, and shows products that have most of those
attributes.  To make search efficient, the data is organized using
appropriate data structures, such as balanced trees.  But, if products
are organized by Name, how can search by price implemented efficiently?
The solution, called indexing in databases, is to create a new set of
references to the objects for each search field, and organize them to
implement search operations on that field efficiently.  As the objects
change, these access structures have to be kept consistent.

In this project, each object has 3 attributes: id (long int), name
(one or more long ints), and price (dollars and cents).  The following
operations are supported:

   a. Insert(id,price,name): insert a new item.  If an entry with the
      same id already exists, its name and price are replaced by the
      new values.  If name is empty, then just the price is updated.
      Returns 1 if the item is new, and 0 otherwise.

   b. Find(id): return price of item with given id (or 0, if not found).

   c. Delete(id): delete item from storage.  Returns the sum of the
      long ints that are in the name of the item deleted (or 0, if
      such an id did not exist).

   d. FindMinPrice(n): given a long int n, find items whose name
      contains n (exact match with one of the long ints in the item's
      name), and return lowest price of those items.

   e. FindMaxPrice(n): given a long int n, find items whose name
      contains n, and return highest price of those items.

   f. FindPriceRange(n,low,high): given a long int n, find the number
      of items whose name contains n, and their prices fall within the
      given range, [low, high].

   g. PriceHike(l,h,r): increase the price of every product, whose id is 
      in the range [l,h], by r%  Discard any fractional pennies in the new 
      prices of items.  Returns the sum of the net increases of the prices.


Implement the operations using data structures that are best suited
for the problem.  You may download any implementations of standard
data structures from the web, and modify the code as needed.


Input specification:
Initially, the store is empty, and there are no items.  The input
contains a sequence of lines (use test sets with millions of lines).
Lines starting with "#" are comments.  Other lines have one operation
per line: name of the operation, followed by parameters needed for
that operation (separated by spaces).  Lines with Insert operation
will have a "0" at the end, that is not part of the name.  The output
is a single number, which is the sum of the following values obtained
by the algorithm as it processes the input.


Sample input:
Insert 22 19.97 475 1238 9742 0
# New item with id=22, price="$19.97", name="475 1238 9742"
# Return: 1
#
Insert 12 96.92 44 109 0
# Second item with id=12, price="96.92", name="44 109"
# Return: 1
#
Insert 37 47.44 109 475 694 88 0
# Another item with id=37, price="47.44", name="109 475 694 88"
# Return: 1
#
PriceHike 10 22 10
# 10% price increase for id=12 and id=22
# New price of 12: 106.61, Old price = 96.92.  Net increase = 9.69
# New price of 22: 21.96.  Old price = 19.97.  Net increase = 1.99
# Return: 11.68  (sum of 9.69 and 1.99)
#
FindMaxPrice 475		
# Return: 47.44 (id of items considered: 22, 37)
#
Delete 37
# Return: 1366 (=109+475+694+88)
#
FindMaxPrice 475		
# Return: 21.96 (id of items considered: 22)
#
